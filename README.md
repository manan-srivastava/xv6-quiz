Bonus Question:
11. Who developed XV6?

 Answer: c. MIT

12. Process States in XV6:
Running: The process is currently executing instructions.
Runnable: The process is ready to run but is waiting for the CPU.
Sleeping: The process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O) to complete.
Zombie: The process has completed its execution, but its exit status is still needed by its parent.

13. Inodes: Each file is represented by an inode, which stores metadata about the file.
Data Blocks: Actual data of files stored in blocks.
Directory Entries: Map names to inodes.
Superblock: Contains key parameters about the file system, such as the size and location of the inode table.

14. System Calls: Interface to the operating system services. Examples include fork(), exit(), and read().
Library Functions: Built on top of system calls, often written in C, and provide higher-level functionality. Examples include printf(), malloc(), and strlen().

15. Memory Paging in XV6:
Paging: Memory is divided into fixed-size pages. The operating system swaps pages in and out of physical memory as needed.
Benefits: Allows efficient use of physical memory, simplifies memory management, and provides isolation between processes.

16. Essential Shell Commands in XV6:
ls: Lists directory contents.
cd: Changes the current working directory.
cp: Copies files or directories.

17. Process Synchronization in XV6:
Essential for: Ensuring orderly execution and resource sharing among multiple processes.
Mechanisms: XV6 uses locks, semaphores, and condition variables for synchronization.

18. Interrupt Handling in XV6:
Role: Interrupts are events that cause the CPU to temporarily transfer control to a special set of routines. They handle external events like I/O completion.
Handling: Handled through interrupt service routines (ISRs), which are specific to the type of interrupt.

19. Virtual Memory in XV6:
Implementation: Achieved through demand paging and page tables.
Advantages: Allows efficient use of memory, enables memory protection, and simplifies memory management.

20. Boot Process in XV6:
BIOS/UEFI: Initiates the boot process, loads the bootloader.
Bootloader: Loads the XV6 kernel into memory.
Kernel Initialization: Sets up essential data structures and initializes devices.
User Space: The kernel transfers control to the init process in user space, which initializes the user environment.
